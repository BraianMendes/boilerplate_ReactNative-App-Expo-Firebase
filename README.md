This React Native Firebase starter contains a few key features that all apps backed by Fireabase support:

* Registration with E-mail & Password
* Login with E-mail and Password
* Handling persisted login credentials
* Navigation (react-native-navigation)
* Writing to Firestore Database
* Reading from Firestore Database
* Creating Firestore indices (for performance)

This React Native Firebase starter is built with Firebase Web SDK, which makes it compatible with both Expo CLI and React Native CLI.
